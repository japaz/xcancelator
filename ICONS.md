# X Cancelator Icons

This extension uses simple text-based icons for now. You can replace these with proper PNG icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - For browser toolbar
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - For extension management page  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - For Chrome Web Store

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons with:
1. A red "X" with a line through it
2. An arrow pointing from X to "xcancel"
3. Simple text "XC" for X Cancelator

For now, the extension works without icons but shows a default browser extension icon.
